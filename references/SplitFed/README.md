# SplitFed: When Federated Learning Meets Split Learning

Releasing the source code version1 of our work "SplitFed: When Federated Learning Meets Split Learning."

We have three versions of our programs:

Version1: without using socket and no DP+PixelDP

Version2: with using socket but no DP+PixelDP

Version3: without using socket but with DP+PixelDP (required more packages)

Other versions will be released soon.
